## Quick Start

1. Clone this project

2. Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed.

3. To simply see the website run `npm run dev`

## Running the Ao3 data script

The script is available in [script/index.ts](script/index.ts), and to run it you need to download the March 3rd, 2021 Archive of Our Own [Selective data dump for fan statisticians](https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/18804).
Unzip the files and name them `tags.csv` and `works.csv` in the root of this project.

After this, run `npm run generate`. This will generate all new data files (based on old data) into `public/data`.

If you have any concerns or ideas for improvements feel free to open an issue, or submit a Pull Request :)
